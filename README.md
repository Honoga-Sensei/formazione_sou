# Introduction
## DevOps Academy
This repository was created with the intent to push exercises and activities assigned to me during the DevOps Academy I'm taking part of. With time, in this repo there will be added more folders, files and scripts regarding different concepts that I will work on during the DevOps Academy.
## Getting Started
> [!NOTE]
> Not all scripts were created to be foolproof, some of them are simply made to express a concept or try some commands.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All scripts were created using bash (Bourne Again SHell), so use `bash` or `sh` to execute them.

An example could be:
```
bash Script-0.sh
```
```
sh Script-0.sh
```
